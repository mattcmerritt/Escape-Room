  ClueDescription: "You\u2019re close to unlocking the area code! The <b>first number</b>
    is the number of letters in your patient\u2019s first name. The <b>second number</b>
    is the number of professions on the magnetic board. The <b>third number</b> is
    the number of locks being used on the cabinets in this room. To make sure you
    have the right area code, unlock the red number lock. \n\nTo find the remaining
    7 digits of the caregiver\u2019s phone number, identify the generic names of
    the 7 \u201Ccalm down pills\u201D that the patient could be referring to \u2013
    the name of each medication will be on a specific page. <b>Not sure where to
    look</b>? Well, you may remember seeing a list of non-medication-based strategies
    to help calm down an agitated patient with Alzheimer\u2019s. Maybe you should
    start there. You\u2019ll know you have the right phone number when you unlock
    the final two locks. \n\nNext decide as a team what information you should tell
    and/or ask the caregiver \u2013 think about what you would actually say in a
    situation like this and decide who should call. Then call the caregiver using
    the phone in the room. If you get confirmation that they are coming to get your
    patient, you have \u201Cescaped the room\u201D!"
  Announcement: Call the number you find from the Medication Guide Book and escape
    the room!
