  FullDescription: "<b>Instructions:</b> Welcome to the IPE Escape Room everyone!
    I want to start off today\u2019s activity by reminding you that as future health
    professionals, in order to best meet the needs of your patients, you must be
    competent not only as a professional in your discipline, but also be skilled
    in working effectively as members of an interprofessional healthcare team. As
    a team, it is critical that you demonstrate shared values and ethics, effective
    communication, teamwork, and an understanding of each other\u2019s roles and
    responsibilities. This activity provides you an opportunity to do just that.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    as you enter the room find the patient where you will find patient description
    and first clue, which should be read out loud. You should talk to each other
    throughout this activity and make sure you are all on the same page. You can
    use the chat box and the notes on the clipboard to keep track of information
    you have figured out from the clues. As you find clues, they will go into your
    inventory, which you can access at any time. Okay, that\u2019s it \u2013<b>good
    luck</b>!"
