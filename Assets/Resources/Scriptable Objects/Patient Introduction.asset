  FullDescription: "Patient Case: \r\n\r\nJohn Doe has arrived to the Emergency Department
    in a state of complete disorientation. He appears to be in his 70\u2019s or 80\u2019s.
    His clothes are stained. He does not seem to know who he is or how he got here
    to the Emergency Room. He is limping and complaining that his leg hurts. He gets
    agitated as hospital staff walk by the room; he is suspicious and repeats the
    phrase: \u201CI don\u2019t trust those people \u2013 they want to lock me up\u201D.
    On one occasion, he looks and repeats the phrase even though there isn\u2019t
    anyone walking by the door. He insists that he wants to \u201Cgo home\u201D but
    does not know where he lives. He states that someone was waiting for him and
    he is worried about being \u201Clate\u201D. He says that he wants his \u201Ccalm
    down\u201D pill but doesn\u2019t know where it is.  \r\n\r\nObjective: Find out
    John Doe\u2019s real name, his address, and his caregiver\u2019s name and phone
    number \u2013 you will \u201CEscape the Room\u201D when you call John Doe\u2019s
    caregiver, let them know the situation, and get confirmation that they are coming
    to get him.  \r\n\r\nTime Allotted: You have 45 minutes to complete this task
    as a team. You will need to solve a series of puzzles that will lead you to more
    clues. Each member of the team should participate. You are being evaluated not
    only on your ability to escape the room, but on your effective communication
    and teamwork skills. Before you get started, introduce yourself and your major/discipline.  "
