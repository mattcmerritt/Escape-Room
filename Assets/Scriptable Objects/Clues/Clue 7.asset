  Description: An envelope containing information about the seventh and final puzzle.
  ClueDescription: "You\u2019re close to unlocking the area code! The first number
    is the number of letters in your patient\u2019s first name. The second number
    is the number of professions on the magnetic board. The third number is the number
    of locks being used on the cabinets in this room. To make sure you have the right
    area code, unlock the red number lock. To find the remaining 7 digits of the
    caregiver\u2019s phone number, identify the generic names of the 7 \u201Ccalm
    down pills\u201D that the patient could be referring to \u2013 the name of each
    medication will be on a specific page. Not sure where to look? Well, you may
    remember seeing a list of non-medication-based strategies to help calm down an
    agitated patient with Alzheimer\u2019s. Maybe you should start there. You\u2019ll
    know you have the right phone number when you unlock the final two locks. Next
    decide as a team what information you should tell and/or ask the caregiver \u2013
    think about what you would actually say in a situation like this and decide who
    should call. Then call the caregiver using the phone in the room. If you get
    confirmation that they are coming to get your patient, you have \u201Cescaped
    the room\u201D! "
