  Description: "To find out the town your patient lives in, you will need to find
    three specific dominos. To begin, calculate the total number of letters for each
    of the three health schools at QU. For example, School of Business has 16 letters.
    \r\n\r\nThen find the dominos that have the highest possible number of dots on
    the top half. As you are looking, do not destroy or modify any of the dominos.
    \r\n\r\nFrom those, find the three specific dominos that have the number of dots
    on the lower half that, when added to number of upper half dots, total the number
    of letters in the name of that health school. There will be one domino for each
    health school.  \r\n\r\nThen look on the back side of each of the three dominos
    for your next clue, but beware, looks can be deceiving! Thankfully, something
    close by can light the way. Reminder: to solve this clue nothing needs to be
    destroyed or modified."
  Announcement: Find the dominos that add up to the number of letters in each health
    school. There are secrets on the back!
