  ClueDescription: "Hang onto this key \u2013 you never know when this key might
    prove advantageous! Question: Which of the health professions that were on the
    QU pill bottles (both who prescribe as well as those who do not) have a set of
    ethical standards or code of professional ethics that they are legally bound
    to uphold? When you have the answer to the question, <b>look for that specific
    word</b> \u2013 it may be small, but it did score more for sitting on the triple
    word of this fun American word game! When you find that word you\u2019ll discover
    the patient\u2019s last name nearby. Unlock the next clue using the patient\u2019s
    last name."
