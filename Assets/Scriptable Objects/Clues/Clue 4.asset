  ClueDescription: "Hang onto this \u2013 you never know when this key might prove
    advantageous! Question: Which of the health professions that were on the QU pill
    bottles (both who prescribe as well as those who do not) have a set of ethical
    standards or code of professional ethics that they are legally bound to uphold?
