    find <b>three specific dominos</b>. To begin, calculate the total number of letters
    for each of the three health schools at QU. For example, School of Business has
    16 letters. \r\n\r\nThen find the dominos that have the <b>highest possible number
    of dots on the top half</b>. From those, find the three specific dominos that
    have same the number of dots as the numbers of letters in the name of each health
    school. There will be one domino for each health school.  \r\n\r\nThen look on
    the back side of each of the three dominos for your next clue. The text <b>may
    not be visible</b> at first, so you may need <b>something special</b> to view
    it..."
  Announcement: 'Find the dominos that add up to the number of letters in each health
    school. There are secrets on the back!
