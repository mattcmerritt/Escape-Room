  Question: What was something new you learned about the roles and responsibilities
    of members of the healthcare team?
  Answer: "As you saw, there are often complimentary roles, such as with Physician
    Assistants, Nurse Practitioners, and Physicians on a healthcare team. Many patients
    will not know the difference between such providers or the difference between
    Occupational and Physical Therapists. It\u2019s important that you can clearly
    explain the complimentary yet unique role each member has on the team and how
    the patient benefits from having an interprofessional team working for them."
