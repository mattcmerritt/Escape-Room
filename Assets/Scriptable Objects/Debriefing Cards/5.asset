  Question: As we consider how this experience mirrors real healthcare practice,
    what can happen to patient care if the team is overwhelmed by having to process
    complicated information under tight time constraints?
  Answer: "We know medical errors are all too common and are often linked to miscommunication.
    Ensuring everyone on the team is on the same page with open and frequent communication,
    understanding of each member\u2019s roles and responsibilities, having shared
    team accountability for patient outcomes can reduce medical errors."
